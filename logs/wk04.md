## what i learned this week
- we have a quiz this upcoming thursday sessions 01-08, on paper, closed notes

- how you use ai will be asked on the quiz? aka we need to torture your ai
- remember to use markdown format for the future weekly learning logs

- there will be 3 required projects and 1-2 passion projects during the semester
- 1 will be website for someone else, a family member, a club, or a local business
- why? because real web development starts with understanding someone elses needs
- you can use ai, but must document what you learned from the ai generated code
- i need to find a "client" now


## what we've learbed so far
- semantic html: &lt; header &lt; &lt;nav&lt;, &lt;main&lt;, &lt;footer&lt;, these things allow you to organize your code and you can collapse these sections in your code.
- if you like someone's site, you can "fork" it and edit your own version
