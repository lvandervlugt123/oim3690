            <p>In the 16th century, the Spanish ruled the Low Countries, but by the late 1500s, <span class="highlight">the Dutch began their revolt for independence</span>. The 80 Years' War (1568-1648) resulted in the creation of the Dutch Republic, one of the first democracies in Europe.</p>

            <h3>The Dutch Golden Age (1588-1672)</h3>

            </ul>

            <h3>Modern Era</h3>
            <p>After the Napoleonic Wars and a period of union with Belgium, the Netherlands gained full independence in 1839. Today, it is a constitutional monarchy and a founding member of the European Union, known for its progressive policies and high quality of life.</p>
